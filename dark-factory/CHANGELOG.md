# Changelog — dark-factory

All notable changes to the `dark-factory/` federation will be documented in
this file.

This federation follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
at the federation level. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Tags use the prefixed form `dark-factory-v<X.Y.Z>` so other federations
in this repo can release independently without collision.

Every release declares its runtime floor as `**Requires:** agentis >= X.Y.Z`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-09

**Requires:** agentis >= `1.18.0`

### Added

- Initial dark-factory federation: an autonomous Solana/Anchor bounty
  auditor. A single `auditor` colony runs an `agentis go`-driven audit
  pipeline (reconn → guard → tracker → synthesis) entirely on the agentis
  substrate, fully offline.
- Real LLM-driven two-sided PoC synthesis: the prompt-driven synthesis path
  generates a proof-of-concept that must exercise BOTH a control (an
  authorized caller is accepted → `CONTROL OK:`) and an exploit (an
  unauthorized caller breaks the safety invariant → `INVARIANT VIOLATED:`),
  so a rigged always-fire harness cannot pass the validation gate.
- Offline `solana-program-test` toolchain: a committed harness crate
  (`solana-harness/`) drives the ingested program through the real
  `solana-runtime` SVM (real account model, signer/owner checks, lamport
  conservation) compiled with stable rustc — no SBF platform-tools, no
  network at audit time. The one-time dependency-graph warm build is staged
  by `setup-solana-toolchain.sh`.
- Human-gated submission: a verified finding is written as a standardized
  Immunefi-shaped report and, at `review-gated` / `autonomous` tier, staged
  with a `pending_human_review` marker. The colony NEVER auto-posts to a
  bounty platform — submission is always an explicit human action.
