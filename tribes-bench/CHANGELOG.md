# Changelog — tribes-bench

All notable changes to the `tribes-bench/` federation will be documented in
this file.

This federation follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
at the federation level. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Tags use the prefixed form `tribes-bench-v<X.Y.Z>` so other federations
in this repo can release independently without collision.

Every release declares its runtime floor as `**Requires:** agentis >= X.Y.Z`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Stage 0 wiring test** ([#363](https://github.com/Replikanti/agentis-colonies/issues/363)).
  Two seed tribes (`tribe-alpha`, `tribe-beta`), each with a single
  `hunter` agent. Plus:
  - `targets/stage0/vulnerable.rs` — ~50 LOC Rust file with three
    planted command-injection bugs (`ci-001`, `ci-002`, `ci-003`).
  - `targets/stage0/bugs.json` — ground-truth manifest keyed by id,
    line, line_tolerance, signature.
  - `tools/verify-finding.sh` — pure-shell + jq deterministic verifier
    (`{"line": int}` on stdin, `{"verified": bool, "bug_id":
    string|null}` on stdout).
  - `tools/test-verify-finding.sh` — six-fixture (3 known-good + 3
    known-bad) unit test that exits 0 on pass.
  - `start-federation.sh` — ADR-0003-friendly launcher that starts
    both tribes' `start-colony.sh` and waits.
  - `tools/run-stage0.sh` — one-shot wrapper that creates
    `runs/<utc-timestamp>/`, `agentis init`'s a hermetic `.agentis/`
    inside it, exports `TARGET_DIR` / `BUGS_MANIFEST` /
    `VERIFIER_PATH`, patches the per-run config (`exec.env_passthrough`,
    `experience.enabled`, `telemetry.enabled`), seeds
    `hunter:confidence = 0.7`, sleeps `STAGE0_WALL_CLOCK_S` (default
    900s), kills the federation, and runs the analyser.
  - `tools/analyse-stage0.py` — pure-stdlib analyser that joins
    `.agentis/daemon/<id>.colony` + `.agentis/experience/<id>.jsonl` +
    `.agentis/spend/<id>.jsonl` per (minute, tribe) and emits
    `telemetry.csv` with the seven columns `minute, tribe, agents_alive,
    cb_balance, findings_emitted, true_positives, false_positives`.
- Both hunters start at confidence `0.7` (mid-`propose` per
  [ADR-0001](../doc/adr/ADR-0001-confidence-tiers.md)). Tribe-alpha
  uses a `format!()`-as-shell-builder seed prompt; tribe-beta uses a
  source-to-sink data-flow seed prompt.

<!--
tribes-bench has no released version yet. `VERSION` carries the placeholder
`0.0.0` until Stage 2 (#365) lands and is judged worth releasing. Once a
real release is cut, this file gains a `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` section
plus Keep-a-Changelog comparison links at the bottom (see
`dev-apprenticeship/CHANGELOG.md` for the template).
